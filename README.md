# Introduction

The last paper of the Panjab University, BCA Curriculum, is the Major Project and
Seminar [BCA-16-605]. The purpose of the paper is to give students an
opportunity to put into practice the various technologies learned during the
entire spread of BCA. Thus the sole purpose of this paper is the application of
concepts and making different technologies work together, which would give
the students exposure to the world of Software Engineering.

My Project is titled as “Banking Management System”. The reason to choose this
topic as my Major Project of BCA is that I want to keep the project simple,
as well as to put into application some of the important technologies learned
during the entire spread of BCA.

The “Banking Management System” application, hereafter referred as
“Application”, is a Web Application which works completely online on any
modern browser like Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, etc. Also,
it designed with the focus to make it compatible on most of the device,
especially mobile devices, which are far more used to perform day to day
activities like Banking. The Application will use Responsive Design technique to
make the User Experience (UX) of using the application seamless across all
the devices. No installation is required to use this Application. Portability and
Accessibility are the key features which made me to go with Web Application.

The Application will perform some of the core banking functions, like Account
Opening, Account Closing, Cash Deposit, Cash Withdrawal, Viewing Transactions,
Fund Transfer, etc.

There will be three types of Application Users, viz., Admin, Staff,
Customer. The Admin will be the manger of entire system and is responsible
for adding and removing the Staffs, the Staff will provide day to day services
to the Customers.

# Platform Used

## Hosting: The Application will be hosted on Microsoft Azure Cloud Platform using Web App + MySQL Service.

## Fronted: The following technologies will be employed for developing the User Interface (UI) of the Application.

### Technologies:

    • HTML: Used to create the structure of the Web Application.

    • Bootstrap: Used to support easy development of responsive UI.

    • CSS: Used to enhance the look and feel of the UI.

    • PHP: Used to build the dynamic part of the UI.

## Backend: Following technologies will be employed to design the backend of the Application.

### Technologies:

    • MySQL: MySQL is used as the primary language for creating, updating,
    deleting and fetching all the Database Components.

    • PHP: PHP is used as a glue language to join the User Interface (UI) with
    the backend (Database) of the Application.

## Common Tools: Following tools are used commonly for developing, deploying and testing the Application.

    • Atom, Visual Studio Code.

    • FileZilla Client.

    • Google Chrome Web Developer Tools.

    • phpMyAdmin.
    
# Modules

The Application has three users, which performs all the actions present in the
Application. The users are Admin, Staff and Customers. The functionalities which
are available for each users are mentioned below:

  ### Admin:
  
     • Login
     
        ◦ View Dashboard
    
        ◦ Add new Staff Members

        ◦ View Staff Members
        
        ◦ View Staff Details

        ◦ Remove Staff Members
        
        ◦ Approve Customers

        ◦ View Approved Customers
        
        ◦ View Approved Customer Details
        
        ◦ View Unapproved Customers
        
        ◦ View Unapproved Customer Details
        
        ◦ Remove Customers    
              
        ◦ Logout
      
      
### Staff:

     • Login
        
        ◦ View Dashboard

        ◦ Approve Customers

        ◦ View Approved Customers
        
        ◦ View Approved Customer Details
        
        ◦ View Unapproved Customers
        
        ◦ View Unapproved Customer Details
        
        ◦ Remove Customers       
        
        ◦ Cash Deposit

        ◦ Cash Withdrawal
       
        ◦ Change Password

        ◦ Logout


### Customer:

     • Login

        ◦ View Dashboard (Account Balance, Last Login Details)

        ◦ View Profile Details

        ◦ View Transactions

        ◦ Fund transfer
               
        ◦ Change Password

        ◦ Logout
    
    
# Conclusion

The purpose of creating the Banking Management System application is to
get a feel of how real world Software is built and maintained. Designing a real
world application like the Banking Management System gives the opportunity
to combine various technologies and make sure they work correctly.
The project does not only require good coding skills, but it also requires great
designing skills which are used in designing the Database and UI. After the
completion of the Project I will have decent amount of experience in developing
Web Application.

At first the topic Banking Management System appears to be very simple,
however developing the same is not so simple. It requires working with many
tables in a database so that during any transaction the data remains
consistent. The data stored in the database is very vital for both the Bank and
the Customers of the Bank. If any data gets altered inadvertently, chances are
either party will suffer a great loss. Clearly, such situations are not
desirable at all. Hence, great care is needed in the development of such
Application.
